## DESCRIPTION

The Milk-To-Analyze Behavior is a simple dairy farm process that describes a 
rudimentary automated milking cycle, where a "Life" (an animal) is being attached to
a milking "Robot". Milk gets collected, the animal is released and the 
produce is automatically analysed, while the robot is being prepared for the next 
milk collection.
